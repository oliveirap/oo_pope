{
	* At this day, user registration class was done. Login class is also done. I can now login, watch for
	* the user status, limit the access of each page etc.
	* We have, so far, 6 classes. Five of my own. Being those: User, Regex, Look, Watchers and Login.
	* The sixth is the Database class, which is very well documented on it's own.
	* TODO: Validate also with a registration ticket. (Done @23-10-2015)
}

{
	* At this day, i detected a problem with the Database class. I don't know if it was my error, but
	* using the chained method did not worked for ticket check. I had to use the query($sql) method.
